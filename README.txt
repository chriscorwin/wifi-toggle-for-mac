1. Open Terminal. You can use Spotlight by pressing CMD + space and start typing "Terminal" until the app appears. Then press enter.
2. Navigate to the location of the install script in this folder. Assuming it's in your home folder (note that the tilda (~) is a shortcut to your home folder):

    cd ~/wifi-toggle

3. Run the install script in Terminal:

    source install.sh


ALL DONE! Let me know if there are issues.
